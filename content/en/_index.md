        , we are committed to the research of trusted computing represented by TPM, aiming to build secure and reliable trusted systems. We aim to provide secure foundations for cloud security, big data, blockchain, SDN, and other technologies. In recent years, building on the foundation of trusted computing research, we have expanded our scope to confidential computing and are dedicated to research in the design and application of trusted execution environment architectures.

        AI security
        </span>
        , we are focused on exploring and developing efficient solutions to address critical issues surrounding privacy. We particularly emphasize the formulation of flexible and robust attack/defense strategies throughout the entire lifecycle of deep learning models, including data collection, model training/ inference, and deployment. Additionally, we actively integrate AI technologies with traditional security domains such as confidential computing, binary analysis, and vulnerability discovery, aiming to contribute to a wider range of security.
